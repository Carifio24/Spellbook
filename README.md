# Spellbook
A spellbook program for D&amp;D 5e. The current version of the program can be found in binaries, for either Windows (.zip) or Linux (.tar.gz). If you're using a Mac, you'll unfortunately need to build this yourself as I haven't found a Linux -> Mac cross compiler.

When using this, make sure to keep Spells.json and BookBackground.jpg in the same folder as the program.

### Things to improve
* Make spell text copyable
* Make spell fields non-editable
* Add scrolling with arrow keys
